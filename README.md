Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple command-line game where you have to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a different number of attempts to guess the correct number.

Requirements - JDK (version 17 or higher)

How to Run

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Akhilesh-Reddy13/Number_guess.git

How to Play

Run the game by executing the Java file.

You will be presented with a prompt to select the difficulty level for the game.

Choose the difficulty level by entering 1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, or 3 for Hard.

Once you've selected the difficulty level, you will be prompted to enter your guess.

Enter a number between 1 and 100.

If your guess is incorrect, you will receive a hint indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.

Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

Difficulty Levels

Easy: 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

Medium: 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

Hard: 3 attempts to guess the correct number.


Additional Features (To Be Added)

Total Time Taken: Add a timer to see how long it takes the user to guess the number.

Hint System: Implement a hint system that provides clues to the user if they are stuck..

Score: Keep track of the userâ€™s high score (i.e., the fewest number of attempts it took to guess the number under a specific difficulty level).
